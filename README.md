# Ray Tracing Demo
A simple **2D CPU-based ray tracing demo** implemented in C++.
This project explores core ray tracing concepts such as ray casting, intersections, and basic lighting in a deliberately minimal 2D setting. The focus is on understanding rendering fundamentals rather than graphics API complexity.
## Features
- 2D ray tracing on the CPU
- Basic ray–geometry intersection logic
- Simple lighting and shading
- Minimal rendering loop for visualization
## Purpose
This project is intended as a learning exercise to build ray tracing fundamentals from first principles. Many of the concepts demonstrated here transfer directly to 3D ray tracing.
## Build & Run
Instructions will be added as the project evolves.
